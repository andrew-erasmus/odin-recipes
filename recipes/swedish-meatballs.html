        <h2 class = small-heading>Description</h2>
        <p>Swedish meatballs are a traditional dish originating from Sweden, consisting of small meatballs made from ground beef and pork, mixed with breadcrumbs, egg, milk, and a variety
            of spices such as allspice, nutmeg, and cardamom. The meatballs are typically served with a creamy brown gravy made from beef broth, heavy cream, and flour. 
            Lingonberry jam is often served on the side as a condiment, which adds a slightly sweet and tart flavor to the dish.
             Swedish meatballs are often enjoyed as a main course, served with boiled potatoes, lingonberry jam, and pickled cucumber slices, but can also be served as an appetizer or snack.
              They are a beloved comfort food in Sweden and have become popular in many other parts of the world as well.<p>

        <h3 class = small-heading>Steps</h3>
        <div class = center>    
            <ol class = list>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, milk, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, salt, black pepper,
                    allspice, nutmeg, cardamom, and egg. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully combined.</li>
                <li>Roll the mixture into small balls, about 1 to 2 inches in diameter.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the unsalted butter. Once the butter has melted and starts to foam,
                    add the meatballs and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes or until browned on all sides. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the remaining butter and whisk until a paste is formed.
                    Cook the paste for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
                <li>Slowly add the beef broth to the skillet, whisking constantly until the mixture is smooth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes,
                    or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
                <li>Add the heavy cream and Worcestershire sauce to the skillet, and stir until the sauce is well combined. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Add the meatballs back to the skillet, and spoon the sauce over the meatballs. Simmer for an additional 5 to 7 minutes or until the meatballs
                    are fully cooked and the sauce has thickened.</li>
                <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve with lingonberry jam on the side, if desired</li>
