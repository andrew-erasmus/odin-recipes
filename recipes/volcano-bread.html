        <h1>Icelandic Volcano Bread</h1>
        <img src= "../images/volcano-bread.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Icelandic volcano bread, also known as "geysir bread" or "rúgbrauð," is a traditional Icelandic bread that is made using rye flour and is baked in a pot buried 
            in the ground near a hot spring or geyser. The bread's unique flavor comes from the natural yeast found in the air and in the soil, as well as from the slow cooking process. 
            The dough is made with rye flour, water, sugar, and baking powder, and then placed in a lidded pot. The pot is then buried in the ground near a hot spring or geyser, 
            where it is left to cook for up to 24 hours. The result is a dense, moist, and slightly sweet bread with a distinctive crust that is often served with butter and smoked 
            meats or fish. Icelandic volcano bread is a popular dish among tourists visiting Iceland and is often sold at local markets and restaurants.<p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Note that the measurements for sugar and baking powder are approximate, as they are usually measured in tablespoons or teaspoons rather than by weight. 
            Also, it's worth noting that the amounts of these ingredients may vary depending on the recipe or the preferences of the baker.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>500 grams of rye flour</li>
            <li>500 milliliters of water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sugar (about 12 grams)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder (about 10 grams)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the rye flour, sugar, and baking powder.</li>
            <li>Slowly add in the water, stirring constantly, until a thick, sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a towel and let the dough rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (392°F).</li>
            <li>Grease a lidded pot (such as a Dutch oven) with butter or oil</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to the pot and smooth the surface with a wet spatula or spoon.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with the lid and place it in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread for 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 1 hour and 30 minutes, remove the pot from the oven and let the bread cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the bread from the pot and let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</li>            
        </ol>
        <p>Note: If you want to bake the bread in the traditional way, you can bury the pot in the ground near a hot spring or geyser and let it cook for up to 24 hours. 
            However, this method requires some expertise and knowledge of the area, so it's best to stick to the oven method if you're not familiar with baking in this way.</p>
